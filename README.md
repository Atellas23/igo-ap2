## Description
iGo is designed to calculate time-saving car routes through the streets of a city. It can calculate these routes by using only the length and maximum speed of a street, but you will make the most of it if the city in question has an open data policy about street congestion state.

This project was originally designed and intended to work with data from Barcelona, Catalonia.

## How to use
You can use iGo either through the `igo.py` module or through the Telegram bot implemented in `bot.py`, in the [following link](https://longdogechallenge.com/). All functions are documented
